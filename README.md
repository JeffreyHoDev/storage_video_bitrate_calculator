This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction
This web application is developed for the purpose of showing colleagues about the storage size required with different parameters such as resolution of video, frame rate.

## Objective
Currently when user want to know the disk space for their CCTV recordings, they have to approach related personnel to ask for information, this becomes very inconvenient and not efficient. Since it is becoming quite a repetitive task, it is better to put it online and give end user ability to get this info themselves, even if they are not technical person

## Features
User can selects the resolution of video recording, frame rate of video, and duration of recording, the system will automatically calculate the disk space required based on the selection. 

Furthermore, user can also view the sample with frame selected to see and feel the effect. There is also a mini wall for end user to compare different resolution videos.

## Limitations
--

## Future Plan
1. Add the save button for user to save configurations to local storage, improve user experience
